  <h3>Introduce</h3>
  <img src="mypic.JPG" width="600">
  <p>Iâ€™m <strong>Hyungrae Kim</strong> and my English name is <strong>Andrew</strong>. (I made a English name because some foreigners was not able to call my Korean name exactly)<br>
  <p>I had finished at <a href="https://eng.skuniv.ac.kr/"target="_blank"><strong>Seokyeong University</strong></a> in seoul about 5 years ago. And I had studied the textile design which means to make some pattern and design for fabrics, clothes, wall-paper and furnitures else.</p>

  <p>But I just wanted to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_designer"target="_blank">Graphic Designer</a> unrelated my major. So, I studied and learned to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Systems"target="_blank">Adobe</a> tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop"target="_blank">Photoshop</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator">Illustrator</a> for graphic design.<br>
  I was able to start working at a graphic design company as soon as finished at University. I used to work making some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand#Brand_identity"target="_blank">BI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_identity"target="_blank">CI</a> and pamphlet else. And I tried to use well and learn more using the Adobe programs. Although I liked do design, I was not able to be satisfied about my low salary.<br>
  Finally, I decided to work at trading company of clothing (Some people say it is the clothing vandor), to earn high salary. I was able to earn high salary more than design field but I was not happy about my every day life. I thought that I had to do somthing for my happy life.</p>

  <p>I just would like to make something crative from now on. I mean that I am trying to work things realted graphing design. More specifically, I would like to work regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design"target="_blank">UI</a>(User Interface), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design"target="_blank">UX</a> (User Experience) and BX (Brand Experience) design. I will show you that age is just a number. Even though I am 32 years now, I think that I am not really late to work at design field.</p>

  <p>If I have a chance to work at your company, I will show you that age is just a number.</p>
